Conda recipe for VISAN
======================

This is the Conda recipe for `VISAN <http://github.com/stcorp/visan/>`_.

The build scripts support ``linux-32``, ``linux-64``, ``osx-64``, and ``win-64``.

Make sure to add ``stcorp`` as channel because VISAN depends on HARP and CODA.

The generated packages can be found on `Anaconda Cloud <https://anaconda.org/stcorp/visan>`_.
